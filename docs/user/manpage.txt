This writer explores the possibilities to generate man-pages from
reStructuredText. Man pages are the way for Unix systems to provide
help to the user. GNU does this with (TeX)info-pages. 

BSD uses mandoc. But mandoc supports a subset of man syntax and the
manpage-writer tries to support this too.

Module information
''''''''''''''''''

Unix man page belong into a numbered section, 1 is user commands, 8 contains
administrator commands, the headlines of all manpages are collected into a
database, queryable with the program ``apropos``, therefore the headline
should contain a short text describing into which group this command belongs.

That information is collected from the title, subtitle and docinfo.

Also man pages have a defined set of sections, that are more or less
mandatory, see References_.

man pages look like::

   man(1)     Man Pager Utils     man(1)

   NAME
       man - an interface to the on-line reference manuals

   SYNOPSIS
       man [-c|-w|-tZT device] [-adhu7V] [-m system[,...]] [-L locale]

in roff formatting

.. code:: man

     .TH man 1 "14 May 2001" "2.3.19" "Manual pager utils"
     .SH NAME
     man \- an interface to the on-line reference manuals
     .SH SYNOPSIS
     .\" The general command line
     .B man
     .RB [\| \-c \||\| \-w \||\| \-tZT
     .IR device \|]

Then the rST input should be 

.. code:: rst

  =====
   man

Conventions
'''''''''''

* man pages have a special structure and organization. From the manpage
  to *man*::

    The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed  by  the
    types of pages they contain.

    1   Executable programs or shell commands
    2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
    3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
    4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
    5   File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd
    6   Games
    7   Miscellaneous  (including  macro  packages and conven-
        tions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
    8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
    9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

    A manual page consists of several parts.

    They  may  be  labelled  NAME,  SYNOPSIS,  DESCRIPTION,  OPTIONS,  FILES,
    SEE ALSO, BUGS, and AUTHOR.

    The  following  conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used
    as a guide in other sections.

    bold text          type exactly as shown.
    italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
    [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
    -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
    argument ...       argument is repeatable.
    [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.

    The command or function illustration is a pattern that should  match  all
    possible  invocations.   In some cases it is advisable to illustrate sev-
    eral exclusive invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS  section  of  this
    manual page.

* new lines in general.

  One should try to comply with the `troff line break rules`__ after punctuation
  signs in the rST source.  Use a new line or two spaces to start a new sentence.
  
  Avoid linebreaks after punctuation signs that do not end a sentence.
  A linebreak can be escaped with a backslash.  In rST, escaped whitespace
  is removed, so precede the backslash by a space::
  
    We recommend the works of E. T. A. \
    Hoffman.

  Consecutive blank lines are merged by the viewer but not on printouts.
  So one has to be cautious. This is most disturbing when printing
  postscript.

* [LMHT]_ Filenames are always in italics, except in the SYNOPSIS section,
  use::

    .I /usr/include/stdio.h

  and::

    .B #include <stdio.h>

TODO - Open issues
''''''''''''''''''

* How to escape double quotes in macro arguments ?
* How to typeset command/manpage names in text.
* How to write long syntax lines.
* Line ends around email or web addresses in texts.
  
  How to distinguish something is inline or not in the writer 
  so to maybe put long urls after the current paragraph ?

* Images and equations are discouraged.
* Lists in admonitions are not intended.
* Encoding declaration ``'\" t -*- coding: ISO-8859-1 -*-``
  in first line.

  BUT if UTF-8 is declared tables are no longer processed.

  BUT we have a comment there and the macros following it

* Input and output encoding are problematic at least.
