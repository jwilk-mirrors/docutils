The ``docutils.core.Publisher`` class is the core of Docutils,
managing all the processing and relationships between components.  See
`PEP 258`_ for an overview of Docutils components.
Configuration_ is done via `runtime settings`_ assembled from several sources.

The `Publisher convenience functions`_ are the normal entry points for
using Docutils as a library.

.. _PEP 258: ../peps/pep-0258.html


Publisher Convenience Functions
===============================

There are several convenience functions in the ``docutils.core`` module.
Each of these functions sets up a `docutils.core.Publisher` object,
then calls its ``publish()`` method.  ``docutils.core.Publisher.publish()``
handles everything else.

See the module docstring, ``help(docutils.core)``, and the function
docstrings, e.g., ``help(docutils.core.publish_string)``, for details and
a description of the function arguments.

.. TODO: generate API documentation with Sphinx and add links to it.


publish_cmdline()
-----------------

Function for command-line front-end tools, like ``rst2html.py`` 
or functions for `"console_scripts" entry points`_ like `core.rst2html()`
with file I/O. 
In addition to writing the output document to a file, also returns it as
`str` instance (rsp. `bytes` for binary output document formats).

There are several examples in the ``tools/`` directory of the Docutils
repository. A detailed analysis of one such tool is in `Inside A Docutils
Command-Line Front-End Tool`_.

.. _"console_scripts" entry points:
    https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/entry-points/
.. _Inside A Docutils Command-Line Front-End Tool: ../howto/cmdline-tool.html


publish_file()
--------------

For programmatic use with file-like I/O.
In addition to writing the output document to a file, also returns it as
`str` instance (rsp. `bytes` for binary output document formats).


publish_string()
----------------

For programmatic use with _`string I/O`:

Input
  can be a `str` or `bytes` instance.
  `bytes` are decoded with input_encoding_.

Output
  is a memory object:

  * a `str` instance [#]_, if the "auto_encode" function argument is
    ``False`` or output_encoding_ is set to the special value
    ``"unicode"``.

  * a `bytes` instance, if the "auto_encode" argument is ``True`` and
    output_encoding_ is set to an encoding registered with
    Python's "codecs_" module (default: "utf-8").

  Calling ``output = bytes(publish_string(â€¦))`` ensures that ``output``
  is a `bytes` instance encoded with the configured output_encoding_
  (matching the encoding indicated inside HTML, XML, and LaTeX documents).

.. [#] More precisely, an instance of a `str` sub-class with the
   output_encoding_ and output_encoding_error_handler_ configuration
   settings stored as "encoding" and "errors" attributes.

.. _codecs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html


publish_doctree()
-----------------

Parse string input (cf. `string I/O`_) into a `Docutils document tree`_ data
structure (doctree). The doctree can be modified, pickled & unpickled,
etc., and then reprocessed with `publish_from_doctree()`_.


publish_from_doctree()
----------------------

Render from an existing `document tree`_ data structure (doctree).
Returns the output document as a memory object (cf. `string I/O`_).


publish_programmatically()
--------------------------

Auxilliary function used by `publish_file()`_, `publish_string()`_,
`publish_doctree()`_, and `publish_parts()`_. 
It returns a 2-tuple: the output document as memory object (cf. `string
I/O`_) and the Publisher object.


.. _publish-parts-details:

publish_parts()
---------------

For programmatic use with string input (cf. `string I/O`_).
Returns a dictionary of document parts.  Dictionary keys are the names of
parts, and values are `str` instances; encoding is up to the client.
Useful when only portions of the processed document are desired.

There are usage examples in the `docutils/examples.py`_ module.

Each Writer component may publish a different set of document parts,
described below.  Not all writers implement all parts.


Parts Provided By All Writers
`````````````````````````````

_`encoding`
    The output encoding setting.

_`version`
    The version of Docutils used.

_`whole`
    ``parts['whole']`` contains the entire formatted document.


Parts Provided By the HTML Writers
``````````````````````````````````

HTML4 Writer
^^^^^^^^^^^^

_`body`
    ``parts['body']`` is equivalent to parts['fragment_'].  It is
    *not* equivalent to parts['html_body_'].

_`body_prefix`
    ``parts['body_prefix']`` contains::

        </head>
        <body>
        <div class="document" ...>

    and, if applicable::

        <div class="header">
        ...
        </div>

_`body_pre_docinfo`
    ``parts['body_pre_docinfo]`` contains (as applicable)::

        <h1 class="title">...</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle" id="...">...</h2>

_`body_suffix`
    ``parts['body_suffix']`` contains::

        </div>

    (the end-tag for ``<div class="document">``), the footer division
    if applicable::

        <div class="footer">
        ...
        </div>

    and::

        </body>
        </html>

_`docinfo`
    ``parts['docinfo']`` contains the document bibliographic data, the
    docinfo field list rendered as a table.

_`footer`
    ``parts['footer']`` contains the document footer content, meant to
    appear at the bottom of a web page, or repeated at the bottom of
    every printed page.

_`fragment`
    ``parts['fragment']`` contains the document body (*not* the HTML
    ``<body>``).  In other words, it contains the entire document,
    less the document title, subtitle, docinfo, header, and footer.

_`head`
    ``parts['head']`` contains ``<meta ... />`` tags and the document
    ``<title>...</title>``.

_`head_prefix`
    ``parts['head_prefix']`` contains the XML declaration, the DOCTYPE
    declaration, the ``<html ...>`` start tag and the ``<head>`` start
    tag.

_`header`
    ``parts['header']`` contains the document header content, meant to
    appear at the top of a web page, or repeated at the top of every
    printed page.

_`html_body`
    ``parts['html_body']`` contains the HTML ``<body>`` content, less
    the ``<body>`` and ``</body>`` tags themselves.

_`html_head`
    ``parts['html_head']`` contains the HTML ``<head>`` content, less
    the stylesheet link and the ``<head>`` and ``</head>`` tags
    themselves.  Since ``publish_parts`` returns `str` instances and
    does not know about the output encoding, the "Content-Type" meta
    tag's "charset" value is left unresolved, as "%s"::

        <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=%s" />

    The interpolation should be done by client code.

_`html_prolog`
    ``parts['html_prolog]`` contains the XML declaration and the
    doctype declaration.  The XML declaration's "encoding" attribute's
    value is left unresolved, as "%s"::

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="%s" ?>

    The interpolation should be done by client code.

_`html_subtitle`
    ``parts['html_subtitle']`` contains the document subtitle,
    including the enclosing ``<h2 class="subtitle">`` and ``</h2>``
    tags.

_`html_title`
    ``parts['html_title']`` contains the document title, including the
    enclosing ``<h1 class="title">`` and ``</h1>`` tags.

_`meta`
    ``parts['meta']`` contains all ``<meta ... />`` tags.

_`stylesheet`
    ``parts['stylesheet']`` contains the embedded stylesheet or
    stylesheet link.

_`subtitle`
    ``parts['subtitle']`` contains the document subtitle text and any
    inline markup.  It does not include the enclosing ``<h2>`` and
    ``</h2>`` tags.

_`title`
    ``parts['title']`` contains the document title text and any inline
    markup.  It does not include the enclosing ``<h1>`` and ``</h1>``
    tags.


PEP/HTML Writer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PEP/HTML writer provides the same parts as the `HTML4 writer`_,
plus the following:

_`pepnum`
    ``parts['pepnum']`` contains the PEP number
    (extracted from the `header preamble`__).

    __ https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/#pep-header-preamble


S5/HTML Writer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The S5/HTML writer provides the same parts as the `HTML4 writer`_.


HTML5 Writer
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The HTML5 writer provides the same parts as the `HTML4 writer`_.
However, it uses semantic HTML5 elements for the document, header and
footer.


Parts Provided by the "LaTeX2e" and "XeTeX" Writers
```````````````````````````````````````````````````

See the template files default.tex_, titlepage.tex_, titlingpage.tex_,
and xelatex.tex_ for examples how these parts can be combined
into a valid LaTeX document.

abstract
    ``parts['abstract']`` contains the formatted content of the
    'abstract' docinfo field.

body
    ``parts['body']`` contains the document's content. In other words, it
    contains the entire document, except the document title, subtitle, and
    docinfo.

    This part can be included into another LaTeX document body using the
    ``\input{}`` command.

body_pre_docinfo
    ``parts['body_pre_docinfo]`` contains the ``\maketitle`` command.

dedication
    ``parts['dedication']`` contains the formatted content of the
    'dedication' docinfo field.

docinfo
    ``parts['docinfo']`` contains the document bibliographic data, the
    docinfo field list rendered as a table.

    With ``--use-latex-docinfo`` 'author', 'organization', 'contact',
    'address' and 'date' info is moved to titledata.

    'dedication' and 'abstract' are always moved to separate parts.

fallbacks
    ``parts['fallbacks']`` contains fallback definitions for
    Docutils-specific commands and environments.

head_prefix
    ``parts['head_prefix']`` contains the declaration of
    documentclass and document options.

latex_preamble
    ``parts['latex_preamble']`` contains the argument of the
    ``--latex-preamble`` option.

pdfsetup
     ``parts['pdfsetup']`` contains the PDF properties
     ("hyperref" package setup).

requirements
    ``parts['requirements']`` contains required packages and setup
    before the stylesheet inclusion.

stylesheet
    ``parts['stylesheet']`` contains the embedded stylesheet(s) or
    stylesheet loading command(s).

subtitle
    ``parts['subtitle']`` contains the document subtitle text and any
    inline markup.

title
    ``parts['title']`` contains the document title text and any inline
    markup.

titledata
    ``parts['titledata]`` contains the combined title data in
    ``\title``, ``\author``, and ``\date`` macros.

Configuration
=============

Docutils is configured by runtime settings assembled from several
sources:

* *settings specifications* of the selected components (reader, parser,
  writer),
* *configuration files* (if enabled), and
* *command-line options* (if enabled).

The individual settings are described in `Docutils Configuration`_.

Docutils overlays default and explicitly specified values from these
sources such that settings behave the way we want and expect them to
behave. For details, see `Docutils Runtime Settings`_.

To pass application-specific setting defaults to the Publisher
convenience functions, use the ``settings_overrides`` parameter.  Pass
a dictionary of setting names & values, like this::

    overrides = {'input_encoding': 'ascii',
                 'output_encoding': 'latin-1'}
    output = publish_string(..., settings_overrides=overrides)

Settings from command-line options override configuration file
settings, and they override application defaults.

Further customization is possible creating custom component
objects and passing *them* to ``publish_*()`` or the ``Publisher``. 


Encodings
=========

.. important:: Details will change over the next Docutils versions.
   See RELEASE-NOTES_

The default **input encoding** is UTF-8. A different encoding can be
specified with the `input_encoding`_ setting.

The encoding of a reStructuredText source can also be given by a
`Unicode byte order mark` (BOM_) or a "magic comment" [#magic-comment]_
similar to :PEP:`263`. This makes the input encoding both *visible* and
*changeable* on a per-source basis.

If the encoding is unspecified and decoding with UTF-8 fails, the locale's
`preferred encoding`_ is used as a fallback (if it maps to a valid codec
and differs from UTF-8).

The default behaviour differs from Python's `open()`:

- The UTF-8 encoding is tried before the `preferred encoding`_.
  (This is almost sure to fail if the actual source encoding differs.)
- An `explicit encoding declaration` [#magic-comment]_ in the source
  takes precedence over the `preferred encoding`_.
- An optional BOM_ is removed from UTF-8 encoded sources.

The default **output encoding** is UTF-8.
A different encoding can be specified with the `output_encoding`_ setting.

.. Caution:: Docutils may introduce non-ASCII text if you use
             `auto-symbol footnotes`_ or the `"contents" directive`_.

.. [#magic-comment] A comment like ::

     .. text encoding: <encoding name>

   on the first or second line of a reStructuredText source
   defines `<encoding name>` as the source's input encoding.

   Examples: (using formats recognized by popular editors) ::

       .. -*- mode: rst -*-
          -*- coding: latin1 -*-

   or::

       .. vim: set fileencoding=cp737 :

   More precisely, the first and second line are searched for the following
   regular expression::

       coding[:=]\s*([-\w.]+)

   The first group of this expression is then interpreted as encoding name.
   If the first line matches the second line is ignored.

   This feature is scheduled to be removed in Docutils 1.0.
   See the `inspecting_codecs`_ package for a possible replacement.
