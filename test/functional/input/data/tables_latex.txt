Tables
======

In contrast to HTML, LaTeX does not support line-breaks in tables with
"automatic" column widths. Each cell has just one line, paragraphs are
merged (the writer emits a warning).
To provide for arbitrary cell content, the LaTeX writer defaults to
specifying column widths computed from the source:

.. table:: problems with "auto" widths
   :widths: auto

   +-----------+------------------+
   | 11        | first paragraph  |
   |           |                  |
   |           | second paragraph |
   +-----------+------------------+
   | content   | 22               |
   | with      |                  |
   | linebreak |                  |
   +-----------+------------------+

Docutils stores table column widths in the "doctree" (in characters,
excluding the separator). In the .tex source, column widths are written
as percent of the ``\linewidth``, computed on the assumption that an
average text line is 80 characters wide. An allowance added to the stored
column widths compensates the padding (``\tabcolsep``) added by LaTeX.
The algorightm provides a working solution in many cases. [#]_

.. [#] Currently, computed column widths are too wide.
   TODO: Account for the ``\tabcolsep``.

For good typographic results experimenting with the "width" and "widths"
options of the `table directive`_ may be required. (Unfortunately, the
interpretation of these values differs between LaTeX writer and HTML
writer.)

Simple tables use often no padding in the source while grid tables
without padding look clumsy. Setting ``:widths: auto`` in the source
whenever possible is recommended. [#]_

.. table:: simple table, not padded in the source

   === = = =
    A  B C D
   === = = =
   100 2 3 4
   EUR b c d
   === = = =

.. table:: grid table, padded cells

   :widths: auto

.. [#] Currently, the last column is extra wide because the
   writer adds a hint "... continued on next page" to longtables with a
   header row. The hint is only shown if the table does not fit on one
   page but always affects the table width.

If a specific total width is desired, "auto" column widths fail,

.. table:: 75% wide table with "auto" column widths
   :widths: auto
   :width: 75%

   === = = =
    A  B C D
   === = = =
   100 2 3 4
   EUR b c d
   === = = =

but "grid" based or explicit column widths should work: [#]_

.. table:: 75% wide table with explicit column widths
   :width: 75%
   :widths: 3 2 2 2

   === = = =
    A  B C D
   === = = =
   100 2 3 4
   EUR b c d
   === = = =

.. [#] Bug: The table "width" option is currently ignored.

.. table:: table with multirow header and "auto" column-widths
   :widths: auto

TODO
----

Limit the total width of a table to the ``\linewidth``, unless the table
width is explicitely specified in the source.

Tables with multi-paragraph multirow cells currently fail due to a LaTeX
limitation (see https://sourceforge.net/p/docutils/bugs/225/).
