SVG Images
----------

.. image:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard.svg
   :width: 48 px
   :height: 48 px
   :align: left

Scalable vector graphics (SVG) images are the only standards-compatible
way to include vector graphics in HTML documents. However, they are not
supported by all backends/output formats (LaTeX, e.g., supports the PDF
or Postscript formats for vector graphics instead). Rendering behaviour
varies, depending on the SVG image itself, the method used to put the
image in the document, and the viewing agent.

.. figure:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/title-scaling.svg
   :width: 40%
   :align: center

   Figure with image occupying 40% of the line width.

   The `viewBox` attribute in the image file enables scaling
   also in ``<object>`` and ``<svg>`` nodes.

All up-to-date HTML browsers support SVG, however not all do this fully
and in the same manner. Some older browsers, especially IE < 9, have
deficiencies or require plug-ins (i.e. don't support the ``<img>`` tag).
Older versions of `webkit` based browsers (chromium, safari, midori,
konqueror) support the ``<img>`` tag but don't display contained bitmap
images.

The "html4css1" writer includes SVG images using ``<object>`` tags,
the "html5" writer uses ``<img>`` tags.

If an image is wrapped in ``<object>`` or ``<svg>`` tags, it
depends on the `viewBox` declaration inside the image's root
``<svg>`` element whether it is scaled or clipped/padded.
Images wrapped in ``<img>`` are always scaled.

SVG images with `viewBox` keep the aspect ratio unless the
`preserveAspectRatio` attribute is ``"none"``.
The following two images are 40% wide and 1.2 em high:

.. image:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/title-scaling.svg
   :width: 40 %
   :height: 1.2 em
   :align: left

Image with `viewBox`.

.. image:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/title.svg
   :width: 40%
   :height: 1.2 em
   :align: left

Image without `viewBox`.
This image is scaled, in an ``<img>`` node
but clipped in an ``<object>`` or SVG ``<image>`` node.

.. image:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard-scaling.svg
   :height: 1.2 em
   :align: left

Image with `viewBox`, 1.2 em high, left aligned and |inline-svg| inline.

.. |inline-svg| image:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard-scaling.svg
   :height: 1.2 em

.. image:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard-scaling.svg
   :height: 5 mm
   :width: 15 mm
   :align: left
   :target: `SVG Images`_

Image with `viewBox`, 5 mm x 15 mm, with hyperlink reference set in rST.

.. image:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard.svg
   :height: 5 mm
   :width: 15 mm
   :align: left

Image without `viewBox`, 5 mm x 15 mm.

.. image:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard-bitmap-scaling.svg
   :width: 2 em
   :align: left

Image with embedded bitmap, hyperlink, and `viewBox`, 2 em wide.

.. image:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard-bitmap.svg
   :width: 2 em
   :align: left

Image with embedded bitmap and hyperlink, without `viewBox`.
Does not scale in ``<object>`` node.

.. image:: ../input/data/object-with-hyperlink.svg
   :width: 2.4 em
   :align: left

.. image:: http://oreillymedia.github.io/svg-essentials-examples/ch14/
           animated_clock_js.svg
   :target: http://oreillymedia.github.io/svg-essentials-examples/ch14/
            animated_clock_js.svg
   :alt: [animated clock]
   :height: 3em
   :align: right

Hyperlinks and script actions attached to SVG elements work in images
included as ``<object>`` but fail in images included as ``<img>``.
Hyperlinks specified in the rST (``:target:`` directive option) always
work. Due to security/privacy considerations, browsers may block
``<object>`` data from 3rd party sources.
