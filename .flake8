# Problems that are either not fixed yet or allowed by PEP8:
ignore =
  E123, # closing bracket does not match indentation of opening bracket's line
  # PEP8 "may either line up under the first […] character of the last line …"

  E125, # continuation line with same indent as next logical line
  # allowed by PEP8 cf. https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/126

  E126, # continuation line over-indented for hanging indent
  # some cases are mandated by PEP8 to distinguish hanging indent from nesting.
  # Other cases improve readability.

  E129, # visually indented line with same indent as next logical line
  # allowed by PEP8

  E226, # missing whitespace around arithmetic operator
  E228, # missing whitespace around modulo operator
  # not generally frowned on by PEP8:
  # "If operators with different priorities are used, consider adding
  # whitespace around the operators with the lowest priority(ies).
  # Use your own judgment; …"

  W503, # line break before binary operator
  # this is the recommended style (changed on April 16th, 2016)

# Allow exceptions for specific files (requires flake8 >= 3.7.0)
